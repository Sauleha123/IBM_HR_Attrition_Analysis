# üìä IBM HR Attrition Analysis

This repository contains my **HR Analytics project** developed during my internship. The project focuses on understanding **employee attrition patterns** and its key drivers using multiple tools ‚Äî ensuring both technical depth and business insights.


## üöÄ Project Workflow

1. **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**

   * Cleaned raw IBM HR dataset.
   * Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
   * Checked for missing values, distributions, and correlations.

2. **SQL**

   * Ran structured queries to extract KPIs.
   * Analyzed attrition trends across gender, department, and job roles.

3. **Excel (Pivot Analysis)**

   * Built pivot tables for department-wise attrition.
   * Summarized patterns for validation before dashboarding.

4. **Power BI**

   * Created an **interactive HR Dashboard**.
   * Visuals included: Attrition by Age Group, Overtime, Gender, Income Levels, and Department.
   * Added slicers for Department, Gender, Overtime, and Job Role for easy filtering.


## üîë Key Insights

* **Younger employees (Under 35)** show higher attrition compared to older groups.
* **Overtime workers** leave at a higher rate.
* **Low monthly income** correlates strongly with attrition.
* **Certain job roles** (e.g., Sales, HR) face higher turnover risks.


## ‚ö° How to Use

1. Clone this repo:

   ```bash
