# IBM_HR_Attrition_Analysis

This project explores employee attrition using the IBM HR Analytics dataset. Starting with Python for cleaning and EDA, moving through SQL for KPI extraction, and Excel for pivot analysis, it culminates in an interactive Power BI dashboard. The analysis highlights key attrition drivers like age group, job role, overtime, and income, providing actionable insights for HR decision-making.
